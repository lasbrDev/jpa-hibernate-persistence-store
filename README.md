JPA Hibernate - Product search template in database.


The motivation for creating this project is to consolidate the concepts of data persistence with JPA Hibernate.
This project simulates the real situation of a virtual store model, where several products are registered and the challenge is to correctly model the database, link the entities and, finally, return the item that was searched for.
